CacheWarmer
=======================

CacheWarmer is a fast and hacky solution to allow people to donate ipfs gateways to cache other people's content.

It practically just wgets the requested hash on a list of addresses (and aborts to avoid getting your file gumming up my ram)

If you want to donate your public ipfs gateway, make a PR adding it to providers.txt
