Python Hypertext Markup
=======================

I've devloped a hobby of developing prototypes of bad programmign languages. PyHP is a fruit of that effort.

PyHP is a low preformance fast development webapp  language. It might be good for prototyping or personal tool development.

Usage is simple, in an HTML file open a <? tag, code in python then close with a ?> tag.

Use the "write(String)" function to output inline into the HTML file.

	<html>
	<body>
	<b>
	<?
	write("Hello world")
	?>
	</b>
	</body>
	</html>
