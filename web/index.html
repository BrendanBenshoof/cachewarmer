<h1> Pin Box</h1>
<p>
  This site offers a simple way to donate ipfs caching to otherusers.
  Feel free to add your own public gateway by creating an issue or pull request at the
  <a href="https://github.com/BrendanBenshoof/pinbox"> Github Repo </a>

</p>

<form action=./pinit.pyhp>
IPFS Hash:<br>
<input type="text" name="hashaddr">
<input type="button" value="Pin it!">
</form>
<p>
  It is important to note, that this essentially just sends a request to each of the donated gateways.
  The owners of the gateways have donated thier resources, and may not be reliable.
  In fact I'm not going to promise that any of this works.
